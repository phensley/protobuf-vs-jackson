Benchmark - Protcol Buffers 3 vs Jackson JSON
------

This is a simple comparison of performance and size between 
Jackson (w/ Afterburner) and Protocol Buffers version 3.


I came across [an article][article] comparing the two, showing PB with worse performance, in
some tests nearly 2-times slower. 
 
My initial reaction was: this can't be correct.  When browsing the [benchmark's
source code][source] I noticed the PB version was adversely impacted by converting
JodaTime to / from string, while Jackson was using a more efficient
serialization.  The profiler showed JodaTime conversion was taking up most of
the time, making PB look far worse.
